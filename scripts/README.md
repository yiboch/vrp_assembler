# 1 reads_simulation.sh
Simulate 50X reads using SimLoRD, then filter out 4~6X reads.

# 2 ./filter_strategy
Package used for filter out 4~6X depth of reads from the 50X reads generated by SimLoRD. This is included in reads_simulation.sh.

# 3 ./main_flow
codes for executing VRP assembler using D-Wave's quantum annealer (VRP_assembler_dw.py) and Google's OR-Tools (VRP_assembler_gor.py)

# 3 commands of running hifiasm
hifiasm -o output_prefix -t 32 sim_reads.fasta

# 4 auto_gfa2fa.sh
converting gfa files produced by hifiasm to fasta files.

# 5 consensus_generation.sh
Use Racon to btain consensus sequence from the preliminary assembly produced by the VRP assembler.

# 6 call_snp.sh
Align assembly (from both hifiasm and VRP assembler) to the reference genome MHC_37.fa, then call SNP sites with the help of bcftools

# 7 switch_error_evaluation.py
Program of calculate switch error rate of an assembly.
